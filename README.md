Developed a Library Management System using Java, MySQL, and NetBeans, designed to streamline and automate the management of books, users, and transaction records. The system included modules for book inventory management, user registration, book issue/return tracking, fine calculation, and real-time database updates. Implemented secure MySQL connectivity, optimized queries for faster data retrieval, and created a clean, user-friendly GUI using NetBeans Swing components. Ensured reliability through validation checks, exception handling, and modular coding practices. This project improved operational efficiency and provided a structured approach to managing library operations digitally.
